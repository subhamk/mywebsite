abstract = "In this paper, we examine the causal effect of political competition on public health provision. Using data from multiple rounds of the Indian District Level Household Survey (DLHS) during 2002-2014, we find that, a one SD increase in political competition raises inpatients by 0.13 per 10,000 population, it reduces the likelihood of pregnancy-related deaths at health centres by 3.6 per cent, while it exhibits no discernible impact on new-born deaths per 10,000 0-4-year-olds. Furthermore, consistent with the notion that politicians are more inclined to provide easily observable public goods that are more electorally rewarding, the results reveal a quantity-quality trade-off in public health provision: political competition leads to  an increase in quantity (or access to health) that is more ‘visible’ and proximate to the voters at the cost of quality (or capacity of health centres) that is harder to ascertain. The under-provision of quality might, therefore, be rooted in its lack of visibility, which arises due to information asymmetries between patients and providers. Our results are robust to several checks."
