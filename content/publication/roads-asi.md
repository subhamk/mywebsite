abstract = "Higher road density boosts manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) by lowering transport costs. We exploit exogenous variation in state-centre partisan alignment that asymmetrically stimulates road building in aligned states for identification. Using panel data on Indian manufacturing firms during 1998-2012, we find that, a marginal increase in road density raises TFP by 8%, on average. Its impact, however, exhibits significant heterogeneity: smaller firms, incumbents and urban-based establishments see most pronounced gains. These results are robust to potential violation of the exclusion restriction for a range of plausible priors, a placebo instrument test, and other sensitivity checks."
