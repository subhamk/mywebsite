abstract_short = "Associational activity increases public provision by galvanising collective action. Yet, majority of discussions on the provision of slum amenities focus on the role of patron-client interactions treating as secondary the local agency of slum dwellers for collective action. In this paper, we examine the relative importance of political competition, associational activity, and slum formalisation (or notification) in securing access to basic amenities in slums. We model local agency by considering a fraction of slums that organize to lobby their interests through slum development associations (SDAs) and make in-kind contributions. Within a probabilistic voting framework, we show that politicians oblige by maximising a weighted sum of average welfare and the demands of organized slums, and distinguish between notified and informal slum status. We take this model to data on Indian slums and find that having a SDA increases the likelihood of public provision for a range of services by 5-11% whereas, the gains from notification is around 14-22%. In contrast, the effect of political competition is relatively muted even after controlling for endogeneity, and surprisingly negative for services with diffuse benefits. Our robustness checks confirm the instrumental role of local agency in slum development that reinforce findings in recent literature."
