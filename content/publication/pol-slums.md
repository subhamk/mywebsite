abstract_short = "In this paper, we investigate the role of three distinct institutional mechanisms – political competition, community participation and slum formalisation – in affecting public provision in urban slums. We present a theoretical model of electoral redistribution where slum-dwellers exercise their franchise and make in-kind campaign contributions to influence policy using slum associations as conduits. Moreover, notified (or legal) status bestows slums an arbitrary advantage in gaining access to public services, which our model accounts for. We then take the model to data on Indian slums during 2002 and 2008. We find that, after controlling for endogeneity, a one SD increase in political competition leads to a 13% reduction in the likelihood of access to tap water and a 10% decline in underground sewerage, which point towards a lack of political will. In contrast, community participation and slum notification both exert a positive impact, although the effect of notification is more pronounced and consistent. Furthermore, our results hold true across a range of public services as well as synthetic indices of public provision and improvement. The results are robust to several checks."
