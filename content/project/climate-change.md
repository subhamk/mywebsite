**Vulnerability of households to weather shocks and the mitigating role of workfare programs**

Increasing variability in the weather poses major economic and non-economic challenges especially for rural areas of developing countries. While some socioeconomic factors mitigate weather-induced burden, others work to intensify impact. I examine how these factors intersect to affect weather-induced burden at the household-level. I focus on establishing the causal effects of weather shocks on household living standards, and evaluate the impact of public policies, such as workfare programs, in mitigating weather-induced impact.

The findings from this project are extremely relevant for policy makers in understanding the heterogeneous impact of climate change. It also evaluates the role of public safety nets in building climate resilience.
