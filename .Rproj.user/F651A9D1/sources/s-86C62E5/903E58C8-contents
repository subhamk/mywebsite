abstract = "What impact do adverse weather shocks have on household living standards? Using a large household panel survey in India and geo-coded climate data, I find that rainfall shocks lower household income by 6%. Consumption declines by 3%, albeit with a lag, while household debt rises by 51%. Rainfall shocks affect rural households and the asset-poor. It shrinks agricultural and non-agricultural wage incomes and exhibit heterogeneous impact across states. A related policy question is the effectiveness of public safety nets in mitigating weather-induced impact. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and the nationwide roll-out of a public workfare program in India, I find that, participating in the program raises household income by 10% in districts affected by rainfall shocks. Moreover, its impact on female-headed households is nearly five times as large. Thus, by acting as public safety nets, workfare programs can increase climate resilience."

abstract_short = "In this article, I examine how variations in rainfall affect household living standards. Utilising a panel survey from India and gridded rainfall data, I find that rainfall shocks lower income by about 6%. It raises household debt by 51%, while consumption declines by 3%, albeit with a lag. Rural households and the asset-poor are most vulnerable to rainfall shocks. As are agricultural and non-agricultural wage income earners. I also examine if public safety nets through workfare programs lower weather-induced income variability. I find that participating in the workfare program increases hosuehold income, with a more pronounced impact on female-headed households."
