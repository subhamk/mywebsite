# Hi !

I'm a Teaching Fellow in Economics at the University of Warwick, UK. I have a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Reading, UK. Prior to joining Warwick, I was a post-doctoral research assistant at Reading where I explored the reasons behind differences in firm productivity using micro data.

At Warwick, [(web-page)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/skailthya/) I lead the [*EC122: Statistical Techniques A*](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec122/) module. I'm also a joint lecturer on the [*EC902: Econometrics A*](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec902/) and [*EC976: Econometrics*](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec976/) modules. I supervise postgraduate dissertations and undergraduate projects in appliced economics. I also tutor students in *Development Economics (Macroeconomics)* and *Econometrics*.

My research interests lie at the intersection of economics, politics and development. In my recent work, I have examined the role of transportation infrastructure in boosting economic activity using Indian micro data. I have analysed the relationship between political competition and the provision of public goods provision where I examine the role of the visibility (of a public good) as a defining characteristic that affects its provision particularly in the presence of political market frictions. I'm also interested in the impact of climate change on human well-being. In a recent paper, I examine the role of workfare programs as a safety net in mitigating the adverse economic shocks induced by sudden weather variability in India.
