# Hi !

I'm a Teaching Fellow in Economics at the University of Warwick, UK [(web-page)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/skailthya/). I have a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Reading, UK. Prior to joining Warwick, I was a post-doctoral research assistant at Reading where I examined the sources of productivity differences across manufacturing firms in India and the significant role of transportation infrastructure in encouraging economic activity.

At Warwick, I lead the [EC122: Statistical Techniques A](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec122/) module. I'm also a joint lecturer on the [EC902: Econometrics A](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec902/) and [EC976: Econometrics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec976/) modules. I supervise postgraduate dissertations and undergraduate projects in applied economics. I also conduct small-group classes for *Development Economics (Macroeconomics)* and *Econometrics*.

My research interests lie at the intersection of economics, politics and human development. My recent work includes:

- analysing the role of transportation infrastructure in boosting economic activity using plant-level panel data from India. 
- investigating the relationship between political competition and publicly provision of healthcare where I find that politicians in India prioritise more 'visible' components of healthcare over less visible components since the former is more electorally rewarding. 
- examining the role of workfare programs as a safety net to mitigate the adverse economic impact induced by unpredictable weather shocks in India.
