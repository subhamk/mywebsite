abstract = "In this paper, we examine the causal effect of political competition on the public provision of healthcare. We separately analyse the effect of political competition, measured by the effective number of parties (ENP), on healthcare access and health centre capacity i.e. the medical personnel and physical infrastructure. Using granular data from multiple waves of the Indian District Level Household Survey (DLHS) during 2002-2014 and an instrumental variable approach, we find that, a marginal increase in electoral competition raises the probability that a village has access to a public health facility by 11%-22% across the primary health network. Regarding health-centre capacity, while political competition increases the chances that minor items are available, its effect on medical personnel remains subdued. We conjecture that this might be due to incumbents prioritising more visible items such as healthcare access for which they can claim electoral credit, over medical personnel which might not be electorally rewarding. These results are robust to the instrument itself being potentially endogenous, to a falsification test that rules out path dependence, and to employing an alternative measure of political competition. Overall, the results indicate a hollowing-out of India's public health system which disproportionately affects the rural poor."

We find that political competition leads to an increase in healthcare access and minor capacity items. However, its impact on the availability of medical personnel remains muted. This suggests that incumbents prioritise more visible components of healthcare (eg. access to health centres) which are more electorally rewarding over less visible components (eg. medical personnel)."
