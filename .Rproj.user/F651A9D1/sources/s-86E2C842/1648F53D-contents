abstract_short = "In this article, we examine the effect of roads on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Indian manufacturing. We exploit exogenous variation in the timing and duration of partisan alignment of states with the centre that affect implementation of road projects to identify the impact of roads on manufacturing TFP during 1998-2012. After controlling for endogeneity of road placement, we find that an increase in road density leads to a 0.10-0.34 log point increase in TFP at the industry level or, about a 12 percentage point increase in TFP for each percent increase in road density. We find heterogeneous impact of roads on TFP: smaller firms, incumbents and industries in urban states see higher TFP gains than their respective counterparts. Furthermore, long-differenced results suggest that besides scale-effects, improving road density affects the growth rate of TFP. Placebo tests on our instrument and several robustness checks reinforce our findings."
