abstract_short = "In this paper, we examine the heterogeneous effect of political competition on government responsiveness. Conventional approaches to examine this relationship focus on the average effect. By contrast, we consider the complete distribution of the outcome variable because the effect of political competition at the extremes of the distribution might significantly differ from the average effect. Specifically, we analyse the effect of political competition, measured by the ‘effective number of parties’ (ENP), on the provision of health centres and on key health service capacity indicators at the local level in India using quantile regression. After controlling for endogeneity, we find that: the impact of ENP on healthcare provision is indeed heterogeneous with larger effects concentrated at the upper tails; across the different quantiles, the density of health sub-centres is lower by 3-12% in districts with high ENP whereas, it’s effect is largely muted for primary healthcare centres. By contrast, service capacities are 10-14% better in districts with high ENP. Our results suggest that politicians respond to political competition by improving easy-to-provide health service capacities, but invest in additional health centres only when seats are relatively `safe', which is consistent with the logic of politicians maximizing vote share per dollar spent."
