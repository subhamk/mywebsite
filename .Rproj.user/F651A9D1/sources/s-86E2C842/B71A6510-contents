abstract_short = "The effect of political competition on the provision of public goods is empirically quite robust but inconclusive. On the one hand, political competition induces efficiency in policy-making through lower deadweight costs. On the other hand, political competition might attract targeted transfers instead of broad based public goods such as healthcare, particularly in multi-party elections with plurality voting. Moreover, weak institutions create political market frictions that might encourage incumbents to transfer targeted benefits at the cost of public goods. In this paper, we examine the effect of political competition, measured by the ’effective number of parties’ (ENP), on the public provision of healthcare at the local level in India. After accounting for endogeneity, we find that a one standard deviation increase in ENP, results in a 10-22 percentage point decline in the provision of primary and secondary healthcare facilities. Our results are robust to several checks."
