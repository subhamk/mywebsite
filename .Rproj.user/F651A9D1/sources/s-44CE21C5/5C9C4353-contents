# Hi !

I am a Teaching Fellow in Economics at the University of Warwick, UK [(web-page)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/skailthya/). I obtained my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Reading, UK. 

My research interests include the analysis of firm productivity, the role of transportation infrastructure on economic activity, the impact of weather shocks in developing countries and issues at the intersection of political economics and development.
