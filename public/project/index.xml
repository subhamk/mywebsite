      <description>Vulnerability of households to weather shocks and the mitigating role of workfare programs
Increasing variability in the weather poses major economic and non-economic challenges especially for rural areas of developing countries. While some socioeconomic factors mitigate weather-induced burden, others work to intensify impact. I examine how these factors intersect to affect weather-induced burden at the household-level. I focus on establishing the causal effects of weather shocks on household living standards, and evaluate the impact of public policies, such as workfare programs, in mitigating weather-induced impact.</description>

      <description>What Drives Manufacturing Productivity? What Are The Productivity Gains From Lower Transport Costs?
The role of manufacturing in economic growth cannot be overemphasized. For manufacturing to reach its full potential however, requires closely concerted investments in infrastructure, training, research, etc. that enable firms to fully utilise the pool of human and physical resources at its disposal. Understanding what boosts manufacturing is important not only because of its high contribution to overall GDP, but also because it creates many new jobs.</description>

      <description>How do political-economic factors affect governemnt responsiveness? What explains the heterogeneity in the provision of public goods?
Governments play an important welfare-enhancing role. In developing countries, public services are often deficient and of poor quality. Why does democracy struggle to ensure the provision of public services in developing countries? To understand this, I examine the relationship between different political-economic factors and government responsiveness at the sub-national level in India.</description>
