Using a large household panel survey in India and geo-coded climate data, I find that rainfall shocks reduce household income by 7%. It lowers consumption and asset-holding, but leads to an increase in household debt. Rainfall shocks predominantly affect the asset-poor and the rural households by reducing agricultural and non-agricultural wage income. Moreover, its impact exhibits significant geographical variations. I then analyse if the roll-out of a major workfare program affected earnings in districts exposed to rainfall shocks. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and the phased roll-out of the program, I find that, it primarily benefits female-headed households. Thus, intensifying workfare programs could increase climate resilience for the most vulnerable population.","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Income Risks, Weather Shocks and Workfare in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1533078000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533078000,"objectID":"ffecd169f57382e2557660e3ae444b98","permalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we examine the impact of roads on manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP). High road density lowers transport cost, which boosts manufacturing TFP. We exploit exogenous variation in the partisan alignment of states with the centre to identify impact. Using establishment-level panel data on Indian manufacturing during 1998-2012, we find that road density raises TFP by 10%-34% at the industry-level.  This translates to an average elasticity of 0.12. The impact of roads on TFP differs by firm's size, age and location. Smaller firms, incumbents and those in urban states see most pronounced gains. Furthermore, long-differenced results show that an increase in road density raises the growth rate of TFP. Placebo tests on our instrument and several robustness checks reinforce our findings. Thus, addressing the shortfall in transport infrastructure can unlock large economic dividend.","tags":["infrastructure","firms","political-economics"],"title":"Road to Productivity: The Effect of Roads on Manufacturing TFP in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Nygaard A"],"categories":null,"date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"91f330837536dff2eed86bf14ff9c465","permalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["slums","political-economics"],"title":"Developing India's slums: Informality and exceptionalism vs. formality and rules in public service provision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"7385b57e0ef11c13eaeaa82a86351957","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"The heterogeneous effect of political competition on government responsiveness in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1506812400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506812400,"objectID":"f981b3b65a00399e04deaa45c156fd3c","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"Political Competition and Government Responsiveness: Evidence from Rural India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"51441b98c70b6e4e4078450e837ba222","permalink":"/project/climate-change/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/climate-change/","section":"project","summary":"What is the impact of climate change on household behaviour?","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Climate Change","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"c3dd9b3a37bcd5ad6d446971a97b7b92","permalink":"/project/firms/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/firms/","section":"project","summary":"How do we measure firm-productivity?

Using firm-level data during 1999-2007, we estimate stochastic frontier production functions for six different industries. We find that: first, although the frontier output shifts outwards, the efficiency levels remain largely stagnant. Secondly, we find no positive impact of infrastructural improvements on firm efficiency. The results are robust to using a synthetic index of macroeconomic variables. Specifically, we find that while infrastructural improvements relating to power generation capacity, electrification of railways, bank expansion or road construction are associated with a rise in a firm's production potential or its frontier output, it is associated with a decline in actual firm-level efficiency. The underlying reason for this puzzle might be a shifting out of the production frontiers over time at a pace faster than the rate of increase in output, which is consistent with uneven utilisation of improvements in infrastructure amongst firms.","tags":["infrastructure","firms"],"title":"Infrastructural Development and Firm Efficiency in India (1999-2007)","type":"publication"}]
