Using a large household panel survey in India and geo-coded climate data, I find that rainfall shocks reduce income by 7%. It shrinks consumption and assets while increasing household-debt. Rainfall shocks exhibit significant heterogeneity. It predominantly affects the asset-poor and the rural households who typically rely on agriculture or non-agricultural wage incomes. Its impact also varies geographically. I then examine if the roll-out of a major public workfare program improved earnings of its participants in districts that were exposed to rainfall shocks. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and the phased roll-out of the program, I find that it primarily benefits female-headed households. Thus, intensifying workfare programs could increase climate resilience for the most vulnerable population.","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Income Risks, Weather Shocks and Workfare in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1533078000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533078000,"objectID":"ffecd169f57382e2557660e3ae444b98","permalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","section":"publication","summary":"An increase in road density boosts manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) by lowering transport costs. We exploit exogenous variation in state-centre partisan alignment that asymmetrically stimulates road building in aligned states for identification. Using a panel dataset on Indian manufacturing firms during 1998-2012, we find that, TFP rises by 8%, on average, for an incremental increase in road density. The impact, although persistent, is quite heterogeneous: smaller firms, incumbents and urban-based firms see most pronounced gains. These results are robust to potential violation of the exclusion restriction for a range of plausible priors, a placebo instrument test and other sensitivity checks. Thus, addressing the shortfall in transport infrastructure can unlock large economic dividends.","tags":["infrastructure","firms","political-economics"],"title":"Road to Productivity: The Effect of Roads on Manufacturing TFP in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Nygaard A"],"categories":null,"date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"91f330837536dff2eed86bf14ff9c465","permalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["slums","political-economics"],"title":"Developing India's slums: Informality and exceptionalism vs. formality and rules in public service provision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"7385b57e0ef11c13eaeaa82a86351957","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"The heterogeneous effect of political competition on government responsiveness in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1506812400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506812400,"objectID":"f981b3b65a00399e04deaa45c156fd3c","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"Political Competition and Government Responsiveness: Evidence from Rural India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"51441b98c70b6e4e4078450e837ba222","permalink":"/project/climate-change/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/climate-change/","section":"project","summary":"What is the impact of climate change on household behaviour?","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Climate Change","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"c3dd9b3a37bcd5ad6d446971a97b7b92","permalink":"/project/firms/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/firms/","section":"project","summary":"How do we measure firm-productivity?

Using firm-level data during 1999-2007, we estimate stochastic frontier production functions for six different industries. We find that: first, although the frontier output shifts outwards, the efficiency levels remain largely stagnant. Secondly, we find no positive impact of infrastructural improvements on firm efficiency. The results are robust to using a synthetic index of macroeconomic variables. Specifically, we find that while infrastructural improvements relating to power generation capacity, electrification of railways, bank expansion or road construction are associated with a rise in a firm's production potential or its frontier output, it is associated with a decline in actual firm-level efficiency. The underlying reason for this puzzle might be a shifting out of the production frontiers over time at a pace faster than the rate of increase in output, which is consistent with uneven utilisation of improvements in infrastructure amongst firms.","tags":["infrastructure","firms"],"title":"Infrastructural Development and Firm Efficiency in India (1999-2007)","type":"publication"}]
