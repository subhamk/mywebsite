Using data from multiple rounds of the Indian District Level Household Survey (DLHS) during 2002-2014, we find that, a one SD increase in political competition raises inpatients by 0.13 per 10,000 population, it reduces the likelihood of pregnancy-related deaths at health centres by 3.6 per cent, while it exhibits no discernible impact on new-born deaths per 10,000 0-4-year-olds. Furthermore, consistent with the notion that politicians are more inclined to provide easily observable public goods that are more electorally rewarding, the results reveal a quantity-quality trade-off in public health provision: political competition leads to  an increase in quantity (or access to health) that is more ‘visible’ and proximate to the voters at the cost of quality (or capacity of health centres) that is harder to ascertain. The under-provision of quality might, therefore, be rooted in its lack of visibility, which arises due to information asymmetries between patients and providers. Our results are robust to several checks.","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"Political Competition and Public Health","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"ffecd169f57382e2557660e3ae444b98","permalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roads-asi/","section":"publication","summary":"Higher road density boosts manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) by lowering transport costs. We exploit exogenous variation in state-centre partisan alignment that asymmetrically stimulates road building in aligned states for identification.

Its impact, however, exhibits significant heterogeneity: smaller firms, incumbents and urban-based establishments see most pronounced gains. These results are robust to potential violation of the exclusion restriction for a range of plausible priors, a placebo instrument test, and other sensitivity checks.","tags":["infrastructure","firms","political-economics"],"title":"Road to Productivity: The Effect of Roads on Manufacturing TFP in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S"],"categories":null,"date":1535756400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535756400,"objectID":"6686e18464e09dd408f1f1e4d4064f82","permalink":"/publication/weather-stress/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/weather-stress/","section":"publication","summary":"Weather shocks pose significant income risks. Using a large household panel survey in India and geo-coded climate data, I find that rainfall shocks reduce income by 7%. It shrinks consumption and assets while increasing household-debt. Rainfall shocks exhibit significant heterogeneity. It predominantly affects the asset-poor and the rural households who typically rely on agriculture or non-agricultural wage incomes. Its impact also varies geographically. I then examine if the roll-out of a major public workfare program improved earnings of its participants in districts that were exposed to rainfall shocks. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and the phased roll-out of the program, I find that it primarily benefits female-headed households. Thus, intensifying workfare programs could increase climate resilience for the most vulnerable population.","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Vulnerability of Households to Weather Shocks and the Mitigating Role of Workfare Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1533078000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533078000,"objectID":"558ff30d10d3c18cdaf9dea5daf8695e","permalink":"/publication/pol-edu-spatial/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-edu-spatial/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine the political-economics of public provision when spatial dependence is a concern. Spatial dependence might arise due to several reasons. Yardstick competition, voter mobility, or spillovers among neighbouring jurisdictions are few such reasons. Using district-level school facility data from India, we find that, on average, a district has one more primary school for every six additions in neighbouring districts. The degree of spatial dependence differs by school level, infrastructure type and geographic region. It is larger for primary schools. Spatial dependence is stronger in South India and is more pronounced for school buildings and grants. With regard to political-economic factors, schools have better infrastructure when turnout is high and the seats are safe. We also find positive effect of political reservation of disadvantaged groups on school infrastructure. Our results are robust to several checks. Thus, vertical policy coordination would reduce deadweight loss and improve efficiency in public provision..","tags":["political-economics"],"title":"Spatial Interactions and the Political Economics of Public Provision: Evidence from India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Nygaard A"],"categories":null,"date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"91f330837536dff2eed86bf14ff9c465","permalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-slums/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the large number of people living in slums around the world, our understanding of the mechanisms that slum dwellers use to secure access to public services remains incomplete. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which political competition, associational lobbying and top-down slum formalisation affect public provision in urban slums. We present a theoretical model of electoral redistribution where slum dwellers lobby for public services by making in-kind campaign contributions (e.g. by boosting attendance at rallies which mobilizes votes) using slum associations as conduits. We take the model to data on Indian slums which we combine with district-level assembly election results during 2002 and 2008. We find that, after controlling for endogeneity, political competition reduces the likelihood of access to tap-water and sewerage within slums but does not affect other public services, which point towards a lack of political will. In contrast, consistent with our model, both associational lobbying and slum notification positively affect public provision in slums, although the impact of the latter is much more pronounced. Our results are robust to several checks.","tags":["slums","political-economics"],"title":"Political Competition, Associational Lobbying and Legal Status: The Political Economics of Public Provision in Urban Slums","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"7385b57e0ef11c13eaeaa82a86351957","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-qr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"The heterogeneous effect of political competition on government responsiveness in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kailthya S","Kambhampati U"],"categories":null,"date":1506812400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506812400,"objectID":"f981b3b65a00399e04deaa45c156fd3c","permalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pol-health-iv/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["health","political-economics"],"title":"Political Competition and Government Responsiveness: Evidence from Rural India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"51441b98c70b6e4e4078450e837ba222","permalink":"/project/climate-change/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/climate-change/","section":"project","summary":"What is the impact of climate change on household behaviour?","tags":["climate-change"],"title":"Climate Change","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"c3dd9b3a37bcd5ad6d446971a97b7b92","permalink":"/project/firms/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/firms/","section":"project","summary":"How do we measure firm-productivity?

Using firm-level data during 1999-2007, we estimate stochastic frontier production functions for six different industries. We find that: first, although the frontier output shifts outwards, the efficiency levels remain largely stagnant. Secondly, we find no positive impact of infrastructural improvements on firm efficiency. The results are robust to using a synthetic index of macroeconomic variables. Specifically, we find that while infrastructural improvements relating to power generation capacity, electrification of railways, bank expansion or road construction are associated with a rise in a firm's production potential or its frontier output, it is associated with a decline in actual firm-level efficiency. The underlying reason for this puzzle might be a shifting out of the production frontiers over time at a pace faster than the rate of increase in output, which is consistent with uneven utilisation of improvements in infrastructure amongst firms.","tags":["infrastructure","firms"],"title":"Infrastructural Development and Firm Efficiency in India (1999-2007)","type":"publication"}]
