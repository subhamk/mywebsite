      <description>Vulnerability of households to weather shocks and the mitigating role of workfare programs
Increasing variability in the weather poses major economic and non-economic challenges especially for rural areas of developing countries. While some socioeconomic factors mitigate weather-induced burden, others work to intensify impact. I examine how these factors intersect to affect weather-induced burden at the household-level. I focus on establishing the causal effects of weather shocks on household living standards, and evaluate the impact of public policies, such as workfare programs, in mitigating weather-induced impact.</description>
